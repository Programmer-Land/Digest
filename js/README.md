## JavaScript notebooks

Extremely handy thing when you are going to take notes on part of JS having browser-independent implementation.

It is based on Node.js.

Packages can be installed and used. 

*NB: package should either be installed locally (in the directory with notebooks) or in case of global installation npm link should be called from directory with notebooks.*

Node.js kernel installation is rather straigntforward:
1. Install <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/' target='_blank'> Node.js </a>
2. pip install nodejs
3. npm install -g ijavascript
4. ijsinstall

That's it. Now you will see Javascript(Node.js) among kernel options.
